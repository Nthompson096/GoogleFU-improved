# GoogleFU
A tool that sorts out the information found on Google. <br>
It sorts them into 8 categorys (this can change anytime):
 - Socials
 - Pastes
 - Ratings
 - Blogs
 - Hacking
 - Programming
 - Images
 - Other

<br>

## Installation & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nthompson096/GoogleFU-improved.git
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Be careful about doing this too much, it will flag for too much requests.
